The application i chose to make is a notes app 
Because its the easyest way of showing databases in action easyly,because we're using simple text
I looked at a couple of tutorials about how to make a notes app, luckly there are plenty
I used different packages because i needed to save diffrent java classes
I started constructing a database making a table for Notes, wich has a primary key 
and that increments automaticaly so that i'll have notes 1 notes 2 and so on
In the tutorials i've seen  how to do getNote of one, getAllNotes for all and getNotesCount for their number
Used RecyclerTouchListner class for add ing events when we touch a note and MyDividerItemDecoration for separating the notes
For the XML-s made a note dialog for EditText and in main activity we have the functions such as createNote and showNoteDialog
toggleEmptyNotes is a nice addition because it can change the visibility
